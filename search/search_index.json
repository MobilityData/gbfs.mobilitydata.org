GBFS enables the exchange of information in a way that ensures all parties agree on what the information represents. You can think of it like a dictionary, where each term has a definition and a set of rules for how it can be used. GBFS is a real-time data specification. It describes the current status of a mobility system at this point in time. GBFS does not support, and is not intended for historical data such as trip or maintenance records. Open Data Standards \u00b6 What is an open data standard? An open data standard is a documented set of requirements that describe how people and organizations can produce and distribute data on a particular subject. Open data standards are typically developed \u201cin the open\u201d meaning the public has a way to contribute. What open data standards is GBFS built on? Follow any of links the below to learn more about the open data standards used by GBFS: JSON GeoJSON POSIX IETF BCP 47 WGS84 IANA Time Zones OSM Opening Hours ISO 3166 ISO 8601 ITU E.164 What is JSON? JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation. It is a lightweight text format for storing and transporting data, that is easy to understand and read. More information about JSON can be found at https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp . What is GeoJSON? GeoJSON is an open data standard for denoting geographical features (lines and polygons) and their attributes in JSON format. More information on GeoJSON can be found at https://geojson.org/ . Uses of GBFS \u00b6 Why was GBFS created? GBFS was created to make real-time shared mobility information available in a standardized format to support the development of traveler facing applications. GBFS specifies how shared mobility data should be structured for proper interoperability of systems. Before the creation of GBFS, shared mobility systems each used different proprietary data formats, making it difficult for application developers to create tools for travellers. Why is it important for GBFS data to be openly available? Public GBFS feeds help facilitate the discovery of mobility services, increasing access to shared mobility. Third party application built using these data can lead to increased visibility and customer acquisition for shared mobility services. Public data provide transparency around businesses that are permitted to operate in the public right of way. This transparency can increase public trust of shared mobility operators and their services. Do private GBFS feeds exist? GBFS is a specification for public data, however some GBFS producers have elected to publish private feeds that require authentication using an API key or login. Great care has been taken in the development of GBFS to ensure that data contained in the specification does not adversely affect user privacy. Requiring authentication of GBFS data greatly diminishes its value as a source of public information. How is GBFS different from MDS? GBFS is a real-time public data specification for consumer-facing applications, whereas MDS is not public data and is intended for use only by regulators. GBFS provides real-time data to support the discovery and use of mobility systems by travelers. MDS contains both real-time and historical data that is used by cities to monitor and regulate shared mobility operators. All MDS compatible Provider feeds must also publish a public GBFS feed. What are the benefits of using GBFS? For providers, GBFS means an end to a patch-work of regulation that requires different data in different formats for each city in which they operate. Standardization provides assurance to providers that data requests can be clearly defined and are fully implementable. As a consensus-based, open source standard, providers have an equal voice along with cities in the ongoing development of the GBFS specification. Comprehensive documentation and resources are available to cities and providers alike to aid in implementation. For consumers, data standardization allows application developers to aggregate data from multiple providers across multiple markets. GBFS can eliminate the need for bespoke solutions for each mobility service. For cities, requiring GBFS data as part of a shared mobility program can help to increase access to shared mobility services. GBFS provides municipalities and agencies with a standardized way to ingest, analyze, and compare data generated by shared mobility systems. Standardization of mobility data through GBFS has resulted in a growing marketplace of data management software and services. These products and services are used to assist cities in working with GBFS data to effectively manage and regulate mobility services. Does GBFS contain personal data? GBFS does not contain personal data. Given the real-time nature of the data, as well as other safety measures such as rotating vehicle IDs, a user\u2019s information will never be shared and a user or individual trips will not be able to be traced. Does GBFS contain operational data? GBFS does not contain operational data. GBFS only contains real-time data that is beneficial to the customer for their trips. GBFS Data Sources \u00b6 Where can I find GBFS data? A catalog of public GBFS data sources, know as systems.csv , is maintained on the GBFS GitHub repository. Why is systems.csv important? The systems.csv catalog is the primary index of GBFS data sources, it allows developers to build software on top of it, provides a source for research projects, and demonstrates the reach of the specification worldwide. Who maintains systems.csv? The systems.csv catalog is currently maintained by MobilityData and the GBFS community. If you have or are aware of a system that does not appear on the list please add it by opening a pull request or notify MoblityData at: sharedmobility@mobilitydata.org . Are all of the systems in systems.csv compliant with the specification? No - there is no compliance or validation requirement for inclusion in systems.csv. To be considered fully compliant with GBFS, systems MUST have an entry in the systems.csv file. Shared Mobility \u00b6 What is shared mobility? Shared mobility in the context of GBFS refers to transportation services where resources like vehicles are shared between users. Examples of the types shared mobility services represented by GBFS are shared bikes, scooters, mopeds and cars. What is shared micromobility? Shared micromobility typically refers to small, lightweight vehicles that are hired by the end user. Examples include bikes, ebikes, scooters, etc. Why is GBFS named GBFS if it covers modes other than bikes? While GBFS, or the General Bikeshare Feed Specification, has its roots in bikesharing, it has been expanded as the shared mobility industry has evolved to encompass all forms of shared mobility vehicles. The GBFS name is now familiar across the industry and the community had agreed that a name change at this point would be a source of confusion. Governance and Change Process \u00b6 How is the specification updated? GBFS is an open source project developed under a consensus-based governance model. Contributors come from across the shared mobility industry, public sector, civic technology and elsewhere. Proposals for changes or additions to the specification are made through Pull Requests. Once the community has had adequate time to comment and iterate on a proposal, the proposal is put to a vote. If the proposal passes, it becomes part of a release candidate. When the release candidate has been successfully implemented in a public data set, it becomes an official release. The complete governance and change process can be found here . How can I propose a change to the specification? If you are interested in proposing a modification, you can do so at the GBFS GitHub repo. If you do not have the solution to the problem and would like to start a discussion, we recommend you open an issue . If you have a solution and would like to propose a change, please open a Pull Request . GitHub \u00b6 What is GitHub? GitHub is a website and service that allows people to work collaboratively on software and other projects. GitHub provides discussion forums and supports version control, which is an important part of managing and storing versions of a software project. What is a repository? A repository, often called a \u201crepo\u201d, is a place where all of a project's documents and versions are stored. What is a GitHub issue? An issue on GitHub is a place for discussion. Anyone can open an issue to spark conversation about the specification, be it a direction you would like to see the spec take, or a problem you are experiencing in using the specification. What is a GitHub pull request? A pull request is a request to change the specification. Anyone can open a pull request and open the floor to comments and discussion. Pull requests are then voted on to see whether or not they should be merged into the specification. Working with GBFS \u00b6 Best Practices \u00b6 What are GBFS Best Practices? GBFS Best Practices are recommendations we provide that are not required under the specification, but that make your data amazing! They are identified in the documentation using the keywords \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", and \"NOT RECOMMENDED\" and are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 , BCP 14 and RFC8174 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here. Why are GBFS Best Practices important? GBFS Best Practices are important so that the end user has access to the most reliable and complete information without compromising their privacy. Do GBFS validator tools check for conformance with Best Practices? Validator tools do not check for conformance with Best Practices, since they are not explicit in the specification. It is recommended to use a manual approach to ensure conformance with Best Practices. What should I do if I notice a GBFS data feed does not conform to Best Practices? If you notice a data feed does not conform to Best Practices, you can try to contact the publisher using their feed contact email found in system_information.json . How can I to propose a modification/addition to Best Practices? If you would like to propose a modification to Best Practices, please do so by either opening an Issue or Pull Request via GitHub. What does it mean to rotate bike_id and why is it important? The bike_id or vehicle_id field is a unique identifier for each vehicle in a system. Rotating bike_id means that a vehicle\u2019s ID will change to a random string each time a rental ends. Use of persistent vehicle IDs poses a threat to user privacy. This is especially important for dockless mobility systems, where a user may end or begin their trip in front of their home or other frequently visited locations. Failure to rotate these IDs after each rental can lead to the re-identification of trip origin and destination pairs which may compromise user privacy. Validation \u00b6 What does it mean to validate a GBFS feed? Using a validator ensures that your data conforms to the requirements set out by the specification. In a nutshell, a validator ensures you have a valid GBFS feed. Does MobilityData have a GBFS validator? Yes. The Canonical GBFS Validator is a tool to check the conformity of a GBFS feed against the official specification including past releases and release candidates. MobilityData \u00b6 What is MobilityData? MobilityData is a non-profit organization that improves and extends data formats, making them easier to use through training, documentation, open-source software, online services, and more. We also create spaces for knowledge exchange, bringing together public and private stakeholders to build the mobility of today and tomorrow. How do I get involved?

What does it mean to rotate bike_id and why is it important? The bike_id or vehicle_id field is a unique identifier for each vehicle in a system. Rotating bike_id means that a vehicle\u2019s ID will change to a random string each time a rental ends. Use of persistent vehicle IDs poses a threat to user privacy. This is especially important for dockless mobility systems, where a user may end or begin their trip in front of their home or other frequently visited locations. Failure to rotate these IDs after each rental can lead to the re-identification of trip origin and destination pairs which may compromise user privacy.","title":"Best Practices"},{"location":"learn/faq/#validation","text":"What does it mean to validate a GBFS feed?

Public access to mobility data builds trust in mobility programs and increases shared mobility adoption. Writing effective policy can ensure that mobility data is both accurate and accessible. This report is intended primarily for individuals responsible for shared mobility procurement and policies at cities or other local authorities. The report provides a foundational understanding of how GBFS supports seamless, sustainable mobility options and how to leverage open data\u2019s potential when writing policy that can influence shared mobility adoption and practice. This report is applicable primarily to cities in Europe. For American stakeholders , see our report on data policy ofr American cities . GBFS makes it easy for travelers to find and use shared mobility. \u00b6 Since it was first established in 2015, GBFS has become the de facto standard for shared mobility data. The specification is now in use in hundreds of cities in over 40 countries worldwide. Policymakers should require public GBFS APIs when permitting or licensing shared mobility operations. GBFS provides a common language for shared mobility operators to share information about options available to travelers. GBFS includes information about vehicles (bicycles, scooters, moped, and cars), stations, and more: Vehicle, station, and dock locations and availability Vehicle characteristics \u2013 type of power, distance that can be traveled on remaining charge Geofenced areas for rules related to speed, parking, and prohibited zones These data are used by trip planning and Mobility as a Service (MaaS) applications, to provide travelers with the information they need to discover and choose shared mobility. Public GBFS APIs enable the integration of shared mobility services with public transportation, allowing users to make first-mile, last-mile connections and multi-modal journeys, making more potential car-free journeys possible. In addition, GBFS provides local authorities and agencies with a standardized way to ingest, analyze, and compare data generated by shared mobility systems. Advancements in shared mobility platforms have resulted in the generation of vast quantities of mobility data. These data have become an essential part of policy making and regulation of shared mobility operators. Data from shared mobility operators help us to understand how these services impact public safety, and whether or not they advance equity, innovation, sustainability, and other policy goals. Public access to shared mobility data increases transparency and makes operators accountable for the services they operate in the public right-of-way. GBFS has been designed specifically for use as a source for public data. To make GBFS APIs truly public, they must be made freely available on the open internet and require no API key, token, or other means of access or authentication. Feeds containing sensitive data that require authentication are not a substitute for public APIs. GBFS enables the exchange of information in a way that ensures all parties agree on what the information represents. You can think of it like a dictionary, where each term has a definition and a set of rules for how it can be used. GBFS is a real-time data specification that describes the current status of a mobility system. GBFS does not support, and is not intended for, historical data such as trip or maintenance records. GBFS reduces administrative burdens on cities, reduces compliance burdens on operators. \u00b6 Unlike bespoke data sharing requirements of the past, the standardization of shared mobility data benefits both cities and operators alike. Standardization of mobility data through GBFS has resulted in a growing marketplace of data management software and services, providing a better quality and a greater variety of available solutions. These products and services are used to assist mobility regulation bodies and public authorities in working with GBFS data to effectively manage and regulate mobility services. Policies requiring standardized open data can prevent the creation of walled gardens, a procurement scenario where cities are locked-in to a specific vendor\u2019s proprietary tools or services. Open, standardized data is portable, allowing cities to change operators if a service fails to meet expectations. For operators, standardization means an end to a patch-work of regulation that requires different data in different formats for each city in which they operate. Standardization provides assurance to operators that data requests can be clearly defined and are fully implementable. GBFS also carries the potential to bring more users to an operator\u2019s platform by integrating with 3rd party apps. As a consensus-based, open source standard, operators have an equal voice along with cities in the ongoing development of the GBFS specification. Comprehensive documentation and resources are available to cities and operators alike to aid in implementation. Recommendations \u00b6 Include GBFS as part of a tender. \u00b6 Your tender should require a publicly accessible GBFS API and should set expectations for the data needed to meet your policy goals. Sample language for tenders Data sharing requirements: A publicly accessible API that conforms to the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) current version available at https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/ . The GBFS API must be available to the public on the open internet without requiring authentication. Determine what data to require in a comprehensive policy. \u00b6 As the shared mobility industry evolves, GBFS evolves to include new features, capabilities, and services. This is why you will read \u2018or its equivalent\u2019 in the sample policy language and detailed GBFS information that follows. Simply requiring a shared mobility operator to provide a public GBFS feed will not guarantee the data will fulfill regulatory or other needs. When developing data policies, it is a good idea to gather input from subject matter experts who will be involved in the program implementation. These may include staff from your technology, licensing, or regulation departments or third parties involved in data analysis. GBFS is designed to accommodate the needs of a wide variety of mobility platforms and use cases, from traditional docked bikeshare to free floating bikes, scooters, and other vehicles. The specification consists of thirteen files or endpoints that contain different types of mobility data. Some of these files and their associated fields are required in order to be compliant with the specification, while others are optional. Which of these files are required by the specification depends on the specific type of mobility system being represented. Optional files and fields provide additional data for specific purposes and use cases. Municipalities may need to require some of these optional files or fields in their regulations to provide additional information in support of travelers, municipal goals, or other needs. Overview of GBFS files \u00b6 File Name Where Required gbfs.json Required \u2013 This file is an index of URLs for all other files published as part of a GBFS API. To make data available to the public, a link to this file should be published on the city or agency website or open data portal. gbfs_versions.json Optional \u2013 This file lists all files published by the operator according to their versions. Maintaining feeds in past versions as new versions of GBFS become available may prevent breaking of downstream applications. system_information.json Required \u2013 This file contains basic information about the shared mobility system, however most of the fields are optional. Best practices are to publish the optional fields phone_number, email and feed_contact_email. Additional optional fields may be useful depending on your use case. vehicle_types.json Conditionally Required \u2013 This file is required of systems that include information about vehicle types in the free_bike_status file or its equivalent. This file should be published by systems offering multiple vehicle types for rental, for example pedal bikes and ebikes. If this file is not published, all vehicles in the feed are assumed to be non-motorized bicycles. station_information.json Conditionally Required \u2013 This file is required of systems utilizing docks. Any station defined in this file must have a corresponding entry in the station_status.json file. It contains a list of all stations, their docking or parking capacities, and locations. It supports the configuration of virtual stations that may be used to designate approved parking areas such as racks or geofenced areas for free floating vehicles. This information may be used to support parking restrictions for dockless vehicles through the use of designated parking areas. station_status.json Conditionally Required \u2013 This file is required of systems utilizing docks and optionally may be used in dockless systems to monitor virtual stations. Any station defined in this file must have a corresponding entry in the station_information.json file.This is a real-time file that shows the current status of a station or virtual station, its vehicles, and its docks. It includes aggregated numbers of available vehicles and docks which may optionally be aggregated by vehicle type. This data may be used to determine equitable distribution of services. The optional field num_bikes_disabled or its equivalent may be useful in determining the total number of deployed vehicles or the percentage of the vehicle fleet that is able to be rented. free_bike_status.json Conditionally Required \u2013 This file (or its equivalent) is required for free floating (dockless) or hybrid (docked/dockless) vehicles. It is optional for station based (docked) vehicles. This is a real-time file that shows the current location, availability status, and other attributes of individual vehicles in a fleet. May optionally be used in station based (docked) systems to publish information on vehicle types, charge or fuel levels, and other vehicle attributes. This data may be used to determine the number of vehicles deployed, their availability for rental, and their distribution within the service area. system_hours.json Optional \u2013 This file is used to indicate hours and days of operation when vehicles are available for rent. It should be required if the service is not available for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If this file is not published, it indicates that vehicles are available for rental 24/7. (This file may be deprecated in the future, in which case system hours should be published using the method described in the appropriate version.) system_calendar.json Optional \u2013 This optional file should be required of systems that operate seasonally or that do not offer continuous year-round service. (This file may be deprecated in the future in which case system hours should be published using the method described in the appropriate version.) system_regions.json Optional \u2013 This file is used to define regions within a system. It may be used to support reporting in systems that encompass multiple jurisdictions. system_pricing_plans.json Optional \u2013 This file describes pricing plans for a system. It is useful to third party trip planning applications but may not be comprehensive enough to model all available pricing for the system. system_alerts.json Optional \u2013 This file is intended to alert users about changes to the system that do not fall within normal system operations. For example, system closures due to extreme weather would be listed here. Cities should require this file for use as a means of communicating emergency or other information to users. geofencing_zones.json Optional \u2013 This file describes geofenced zones and their associated rules or attributes. Geofenced zones may be used to communicate information regarding parking, speed limits, no ride zones, or other rules or restrictions. They may be used to define geographies related to equity, vehicle caps, or other use cases. Cities should require this file if their policies rely on geofence information. Care should be taken when developing geospatial policies that rely on location data. Location data from GPS, cellular, and Wi-Fi signals are subject to interference resulting in accuracy levels in the tens of meters or greater. Data policy recommendations \u00b6 Data policies should include clear, enforceable language outlining exactly what data are required and what version of the specification must be published. At minimum, a shared mobility data policy should: Ensure ongoing access to data for both the regulating body and the public without undue restrictions on its use. Clearly define the format and version of the required data. Ensure access to specific data needed to effectively permit, regulate, and manage shared mobility providers. Protect the privacy of individuals using the mobility platform. Sample policy language [COMPANY] shall provide a publicly accessible API that conforms to the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) current version available at https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/ . [COMPANY] must make the API available to the public on the open internet without requiring authentication. [COMPANY] shall inform [PERMITTING AGENCY] of the URL for the gbfs.json endpoint prior to deploying vehicles. [COMPANY] must notify [PERMITTING AGENCY] at least 30 days prior to changing the URL of the gbfs.json endpoint. Data contained in the API shall be offered to the public and [PERMITTING AGENCY] under a non-revocable license that allows the API data to be used, modified, and shared without restriction beyond attribution. Upon release of a new version of GBFS, [COMPANY] must update API to the new version within [XX 1 ] days unless prior arrangement has been made with [PERMITTING AGENCY]. GBFS API must contain the following endpoints and all fields required under the GBFS specification: * gbfs.json * system_information.json * [ list of additional endpoints e.g. station_information.json, station_status.json, free_bike status.json or its equivalent, etc.] In addition to the fields required under the specification the following files must also contain these optional fields: file_name.json: field_name, field name file_name.json: field_name, field name (1.) 90 days recommended For an example of how a regulator may tailor this language to their particular needs, see SFMTA\u2019s scooter permit language (beginning on page 41). Additional considerations \u00b6 The value of open mobility data can only be fully realized when that data is easily accessible to the public and traveler privacy is protected; GBFS is designed to support both. Cities and agencies should publish the locations of gbfs.json files on their websites or open data portals and on the openly available dataset catalog connected to GBFS. Requesting open data from shared mobility operators will become even more crucial in the upcoming years as the European Commission enforces the obligation for each Member State to set a National Access Point (NAP) acting as a portal to all open data in regards to mobility services and all consumer-facing information. NAPs are designed to support a thriving European ecosystem built on interoperability between mobility modes and regions, reinforcing the ability of any consumer to travel seamlessly within the European Union. GBFS is a common and accepted format that allows countries to comply with the European regulations on several levels: It complies with the will of creating a common open market, which will prevent monopolistic positions; It enables transparency in regards to data and supports the European efforts to open more data for consumers to participate in the life of institutions; It protects users\u2019 privacy by ensuring only public-information are published, in line with the spirits of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); It supports a greener, more sustainable mobility in which users are given options other than relying on solo-driving; It is fully compatible with European norms and standards. In opening the data, some NAPs such as the one managed by Entur in Norway or France\u2019s data.gouv.fr , have set up a team to support mobility operators to open their data. Their guidance on how to leverage GBFS can be sought after, if needed. GBFS has been developed and tested under a consensus model to ensure that data defined in the specification will not negatively impact user privacy. Extreme care should be taken when requiring data from operators that is outside the scope of the GBFS has been developed and tested under a consensus model to ensure that data defined in the specification will not negatively impact user privacy. Current versions of GBFS are compliant with GDPR, in that they do not contain any personal or personally identifiable data. The key point to remember is that with GBFS there is no trivial way to reconstruct a single user\u2019s journey or habits thanks to the mandatory rotation of vehicle identification numbers. Extreme care should be taken when requiring data from operators that is outside the scope of the specification. Data regarding vehicles that are part of an active rental should never appear in GBFS feeds. The over-collection of data \u2014 collecting data without a defined purpose \u2014 is strongly discouraged. Combining shared mobility data with other publicly available datasets could have serious privacy implications. One will also want to be careful with compliance to the GDPR spirit which states that data collection must be adequate and proportionate to operations needs and cannot contain any identifying information without clear consent from individuals. To support better interoperability within the European common market, the European standardization body CEN has developed Transmodel (the European Norm \u201cPublic Transport Reference Data Model\u201d (EN 12896)) \u2013 a data standard that facilitates interoperability between the information processing systems of transport operators and agencies by using matching definitions, structures, and semantics for the data elements used by their various systems. Based on Transmodel, further standards have been defined: NeTEx (CEN/TS 16614-1/2/3/5) for the exchange of public transport schedule information, and SIRI (EN 15531-1/2/3/4/5) for real-time information. Both are currently being adapted for \u201cnew modes,\u201d including shared mobility solutions. GBFS is the only open data standard, used internationally, to be recognized by CEN as compatible and convertible to NeTEx/SIRI based on a canonical mapping soon to be approved by CEN. This convertibility reduces the burden of data production and consumption for all stakeholders of the shared mobility industry.

Requesting open data from shared mobility operators will become even more crucial in the upcoming years as the European Commission enforces the obligation for each Member State to set a National Access Point (NAP) acting as a portal to all open data in regards to mobility services and all consumer-facing information. NAPs are designed to support a thriving European ecosystem built on interoperability between mobility modes and regions, reinforcing the ability of any consumer to travel seamlessly within the European Union. GBFS is a common and accepted format that allows countries to comply with the European regulations on several levels: It complies with the will of creating a common open market, which will prevent monopolistic positions; It enables transparency in regards to data and supports the European efforts to open more data for consumers to participate in the life of institutions; It protects users\u2019 privacy by ensuring only public-information are published, in line with the spirits of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); It supports a greener, more sustainable mobility in which users are given options other than relying on solo-driving; It is fully compatible with European norms and standards. In opening the data, some NAPs such as the one managed by Entur in Norway or France\u2019s data.gouv.fr , have set up a team to support mobility operators to open their data. Their guidance on how to leverage GBFS can be sought after, if needed. GBFS has been developed and tested under a consensus model to ensure that data defined in the specification will not negatively impact user privacy. Extreme care should be taken when requiring data from operators that is outside the scope of the GBFS has been developed and tested under a consensus model to ensure that data defined in the specification will not negatively impact user privacy. Current versions of GBFS are compliant with GDPR, in that they do not contain any personal or personally identifiable data. The key point to remember is that with GBFS there is no trivial way to reconstruct a single user\u2019s journey or habits thanks to the mandatory rotation of vehicle identification numbers. Extreme care should be taken when requiring data from operators that is outside the scope of the specification. Data regarding vehicles that are part of an active rental should never appear in GBFS feeds. The over-collection of data \u2014 collecting data without a defined purpose \u2014 is strongly discouraged. Combining shared mobility data with other publicly available datasets could have serious privacy implications. One will also want to be careful with compliance to the GDPR spirit which states that data collection must be adequate and proportionate to operations needs and cannot contain any identifying information without clear consent from individuals. To support better interoperability within the European common market, the European standardization body CEN has developed Transmodel (the European Norm \u201cPublic Transport Reference Data Model\u201d (EN 12896)) \u2013 a data standard that facilitates interoperability between the information processing systems of transport operators and agencies by using matching definitions, structures, and semantics for the data elements used by their various systems. Based on Transmodel, further standards have been defined: NeTEx (CEN/TS 16614-1/2/3/5) for the exchange of public transport schedule information, and SIRI (EN 15531-1/2/3/4/5) for real-time information. Both are currently being adapted for \u201cnew modes,\u201d including shared mobility solutions. GBFS is the only open data standard, used internationally, to be recognized by CEN as compatible and convertible to NeTEx/SIRI based on a canonical mapping soon to be approved by CEN. This convertibility reduces the burden of data production and consumption for all stakeholders of the shared mobility industry.","title":"Additional considerations"},{"location":"learn/white-papers/data-policy-europe/#useful-links","text":"GBFS Repo on GitHub GBFS Public Slack Channel NeTEx SIRI MobilityData Shared Mobility team email: sharedmobility@mobilitydata.org","title":"Useful links"},{"location":"learn/white-papers/data-policy-europe/#acknowledgements","text":"Shared Mobility Team at MobilityData Heidi Guenin - Director, Product, Shared Mobility Mitch Vars - Senior, Shared Mobility Specialist Jos\u00e9e Sabourin - Shared Mobility Specialist Partnerships, Europe at MobilityData Tu-Tho Thai - Director, Partnerships Europe Newton Davis - Partnerships Europe Reviewers Josh Johnson - Public Policy Manager, Spin Oliver O\u2019Brien - Senior Research Associate, University College London Scott Shepard - VP Global Public Sector, Iomob This document is built with the intention of supporting and helping cities in the GBFS adoption and does not serve as legal advice.

Overview \u00b6 Securing access to mobility data is an important part of a shared mobility program. Public access to mobility data builds trust in mobility programs and increases shared mobility adoption. Writing effective policy can ensure that mobility data is both accurate and accessible. This report is intended primarily for individuals responsible for shared mobility procurement and policies at cities or other municipalities. The report provides a foundational understanding of how GBFS supports seamless, sustainable mobility options and how to leverage open source data\u2019s potential when writing policy that can influence shared mobility adoption and practice. The specific policy language is applicable primarily to cities in the Americas. For the European stakeholders, see our European specific report . GBFS makes it easy for travelers to find and use shared mobility. \u00b6 Since it was first established in 2015, GBFS has become the de facto standard for shared mobility data. The specification is now in use in hundreds of cities in over 40 countries worldwide. Policymakers should require public GBFS APIs when permitting or licensing shared mobility operations. GBFS provides a common language for shared mobility operators to share information about options available to travelers. GBFS includes information about vehicles (bicycles, scooters, moped, and cars), stations, and more: * Vehicle, station, and dock locations and availability * Vehicle characteristics \u2013 type of power, distance that can be traveled on remaining charge * Geofenced areas for rules related to speed, parking, and prohibited zones These data are used by trip planning and Mobility as a Service (MaaS) applications, to provide travelers with the information they need to discover and choose shared mobility. Public GBFS APIs enable the integration of shared mobility services with public transportation, allowing users to make first-mile, last-mile connections. In addition, GBFS provides municipalities and agencies with a standardized way to ingest, analyze, and compare data generated by shared mobility systems. Advancements in shared mobility platforms have resulted in the generation of vast quantities of mobility data. These data have become an essential part of policy making and regulation of shared mobility operators. Data from shared mobility platforms help us to understand how these services impact public safety, and whether or not they advance equity, innovation, sustainability, and other policy goals. Public access to shared mobility data increases transparency and makes operators accountable for the services they operate in the public right-of-way. GBFS has been designed specifically for use as a source for public data. To make GBFS APIs truly public, they must be made freely available on the open internet and require no API key, token, or other means of access or authentication. Feeds containing sensitive data that require authentication are not a substitute for public APIs. GBFS enables the exchange of information in a way that ensures all parties agree on what the information represents. You can think of it like a dictionary, where each term has a definition and a set of rules for how it can be used. GBFS is a real-time data specification that describes the current status of a mobility system. GBFS does not support, and is not intended for, historical data such as trip or maintenance records. GBFS reduces administrative burdens on cities, reduces compliance burdens on operators. \u00b6 Unlike bespoke data sharing requirements of the past, the standardization of shared mobility data benefits both cities and operators alike. Standardization of mobility data through GBFS has resulted in a growing marketplace of data management software and services, providing a better quality and a greater variety of available solutions. These products and services are used to assist cities in working with GBFS data to effectively manage and regulate mobility services. Policies requiring standardized open data can prevent the creation of walled gardens, a procurement scenario where cities are locked-in to a specific vendor\u2019s proprietary tools or services. Open, standardized data is portable, allowing cities to change operators if a service fails to meet expectations. For operators, standardization means an end to a patch-work of regulation that requires different data in different formats for each city in which they operate. Standardization provides assurance to operators that data requests can be clearly defined and are fully implementable. As a consensus-based, open source standard, operators have an equal voice along with cities in the ongoing development of the GBFS specification. Comprehensive documentation and resources are available to cities and operators alike to aid in implementation. Recommendations \u00b6 Include GBFS as part of a tender. \u00b6 Your tender should require a publicly accessible GBFS API and should set expectations for the data needed to meet your policy goals. Sample language for tenders: Data sharing requirements: A publicly accessible API that conforms to the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) current version available at https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/ . The GBFS API must be available to the public on the open internet without requiring authentication. Determine What Data to Require in a Comprehensive Policy. \u00b6 As the shared mobility industry evolves, GBFS evolves to include new features, capabilities, and services. This is why you will read \u2018or its equivalent\u2019 in the sample policy language and detailed GBFS information that follows. Simply requiring a shared mobility operator to provide a public GBFS feed will not guarantee the data will fulfill regulatory or other needs. When developing data policies, it is a good idea to gather input from subject matter experts who will be involved in the program implementation. These may include staff from your IT department, City Attorney\u2019s office, City Clerk or third parties involved in data analysis. GBFS is designed to accommodate the needs of a wide variety of mobility platforms and use cases, from traditional docked bikeshare to free floating bikes, scooters, and other vehicles. The specification consists of thirteen files or endpoints that contain different types of mobility data. Some of these files and their associated fields are required in order to be compliant with the specification, while others are optional. Which of these files are required by the specification depends on the specific type of mobility system being represented. Optional files and fields provide additional data for specific purposes and use cases. Municipalities may need to require some of these optional files or fields in their regulations to provide additional information in support of travelers, municipal goals, or other needs. Overview of GBFS Files \u00b6 File Name Where Required gbfs.json Required \u2013 This file is an index of URLs for all other files published as part of a GBFS API. To make data available to the public, a link to this file should be published on the city or agency website or open data portal. gbfs_versions.json Optional \u2013 This file lists all files published by the operator according to their versions. Maintaining feeds in past versions as new versions of GBFS become available may prevent breaking of downstream applications. system_information.json Required \u2013 This file contains basic information about the shared mobility system, however most of the fields are optional. Best practices are to publish the optional fields phone_number, email and feed_contact_email. Additional optional fields may be useful depending on your use case. vehicle_types.json Conditionally Required \u2013 This file is required of systems that include information about vehicle types in the free_bike_status file or its equivalent. This file should be published by systems offering multiple vehicle types for rental, for example pedal bikes and ebikes. If this file is not published, all vehicles in the feed are assumed to be non-motorized bicycles. station_information.json Conditionally Required \u2013 This file is required of systems utilizing docks. Any station defined in this file must have a corresponding entry in the station_status.json file. It contains a list of all stations, their docking or parking capacities, and locations. It supports the configuration of virtual stations that may be used to designate approved parking areas such as racks or geofenced areas for free floating vehicles. This information may be used to support parking restrictions for dockless vehicles through the use of designated parking areas. station_status.json Conditionally Required \u2013 This file is required of systems utilizing docks and optionally may be used in dockless systems to monitor virtual stations. Any station defined in this file must have a corresponding entry in the station_information.json file.This is a real-time file that shows the current status of a station or virtual station, its vehicles, and its docks. It includes aggregated numbers of available vehicles and docks which may optionally be aggregated by vehicle type. This data may be used to determine equitable distribution of services. The optional field num_bikes_disabled or its equivalent may be useful in determining the total number of deployed vehicles or the percentage of the vehicle fleet that is able to be rented. free_bike_status.json Conditionally Required \u2013 This file (or its equivalent) is required for free floating (dockless) or hybrid (docked/dockless) vehicles. It is optional for station based (docked) vehicles. This is a real-time file that shows the current location, availability status, and other attributes of individual vehicles in a fleet. May optionally be used in station based (docked) systems to publish information on vehicle types, charge or fuel levels, and other vehicle attributes. This data may be used to determine the number of vehicles deployed, their availability for rental, and their distribution within the service area. system_hours.json Optional \u2013 This file is used to indicate hours and days of operation when vehicles are available for rent. It should be required if the service is not available for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If this file is not published, it indicates that vehicles are available for rental 24/7. (This file may be deprecated in the future, in which case system hours should be published using the method described in the appropriate version.) system_calendar.json Optional \u2013 This optional file should be required of systems that operate seasonally or that do not offer continuous year-round service. (This file may be deprecated in the future in which case system hours should be published using the method described in the appropriate version.) system_regions.json Optional \u2013 This file is used to define regions within a system. It may be used to support reporting in systems that encompass multiple jurisdictions. system_pricing_plans.json Optional \u2013 This file describes pricing plans for a system. It is useful to third party trip planning applications but may not be comprehensive enough to model all available pricing for the system. system_alerts.json Optional \u2013 This file is intended to alert users about changes to the system that do not fall within normal system operations. For example, system closures due to extreme weather would be listed here. Cities should require this file for use as a means of communicating emergency or other information to users. geofencing_zones.json Optional \u2013 This file describes geofenced zones and their associated rules or attributes. Geofenced zones may be used to communicate information regarding parking, speed limits, no ride zones, or other rules or restrictions. They may be used to define geographies related to equity, vehicle caps, or other use cases. Cities should require this file if their policies rely on geofence information. Care should be taken when developing geospatial policies that rely on location data. Location data from GPS, cellular, and Wi-Fi signals are subject to interference resulting in accuracy levels in the tens of meters or greater. Data policy recommendations \u00b6 Data policies should include clear, enforceable language outlining exactly what data are required and what version of the specification must be published. At minimum, a shared mobility data policy should: Ensure ongoing access to data for both the regulating body and the public without undue restrictions on its use. Clearly define the format and version of the required data. Ensure access to specific data needed to effectively permit, regulate, and manage shared mobility providers. Protect the privacy of individuals using the mobility platform. Sample policy language [COMPANY] shall provide a publicly accessible API that conforms to the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) current version available at https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/ . [COMPANY] must make the API available to the public on the open internet without requiring authentication. [COMPANY] shall inform [PERMITTING AGENCY] of the URL for the gbfs.json endpoint prior to deploying vehicles. [COMPANY] must notify [PERMITTING AGENCY] at least 30 days prior to changing the URL of the gbfs.json endpoint. Data contained in the API shall be offered to the public and [PERMITTING AGENCY] under a non-revocable license that allows the API data to be used, modified, and shared without restriction beyond attribution. Upon release of a new version of GBFS, [COMPANY] must update API to the new version within [XX 1 ] days unless prior arrangement has been made with [PERMITTING AGENCY]. GBFS API must contain the following endpoints and all fields required under the GBFS specification: * gbfs.json * system_information.json * [ list of additional endpoints e.g. station_information.json, station_status.json, free_bike status.json or its equivalent, etc.] In addition to the fields required under the specification the following files must also contain these optional fields: file_name.json: field_name, field name file_name.json: field_name, field name (1.) 90 days recommended For an example of how a regulator may tailor this language to their particular needs, see SFMTA\u2019s scooter permit language (beginning on page 41). Additional Considerations \u00b6 The value of open mobility data can only be fully realized when that data is easily accessible to the public. Cities and agencies should publish the locations of gbfs.json files on their websites or open data portals and on the openly available dataset catalogue connected to GBFS. GBFS has been developed and tested under a consensus model to ensure that data defined in the specification will not negatively impact user privacy.

Geofencing refactor MobilityData has been working on a refactor of the geofencing_zones.json file. The geofencing endpoint was added to the specification starting with v2.1 in early 2020. Since that time we've heard that it has been a source of confusion for both data producers and consumers. Before opening a PR, we'd like to solicit feedback on proposed solutions.

GBFS feeds are now available in over 40 countries, but few of these data sets use languages other than English. The current specification requires publishers to produce a separate instance of the entire data set for each language they wish to support.

Significant additions were made to the specification in support of carsharing in the current release candidate, v2.3-RC2 Terminology \u00b6 The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 , BCP 14 and RFC8174 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here. Table of Contents \u00b6 Introduction Version Endpoints Term Definitions Files Accessibility File Requirements Licensing Field Types Files gbfs.json gbfs_versions.json (added in v1.1) system_information.json vehicle_types.json (added in v2.1) station_information.json station_status.json free_bike_status.json system_hours.json system_calendar.json system_regions.json system_pricing_plans.json system_alerts.json geofencing_zones.json (added in v2.1) Deep Links - Analytics and Examples (added in v1.1) Introduction \u00b6 This specification has been designed with the following concepts in mind: Provide the status of the system at this moment Do not provide information whose primary purpose is historical The specification supports real-time travel advice in GBFS-consuming applications. Version Endpoints \u00b6 The version of the GBFS specification to which a feed conforms is declared in the version field in all files. See Output Format . GBFS Best Practice defines that: GBFS producers SHOULD provide endpoints that conform to both the current specification long term support (LTS) branch as well as the latest release branch within at least 3 months of a new spec MAJOR or MINOR version release. It is not necessary to support more than one MINOR release of the same MAJOR release group because MINOR releases are backwards-compatible. See specification versioning GBFS consumers SHOULD, at a minimum, support the current LTS branch. It is highly RECOMMENDED that GBFS consumers support later releases. Default GBFS feed URLs, e.g. https://www.example.com/data/gbfs.json or https://www.example.com/data/fr/system_information.json MUST direct consumers to the feed that conforms to the current LTS documentation branch. Term Definitions \u00b6 This section defines terms that are used throughout this document. JSON - (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. This document uses many terms defined by the JSON standard, including field, array, and object. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_datatypes.asp) Field - In JSON, a name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_syntax.asp) GeoJSON - GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. (https://geojson.org/) REQUIRED - The field MUST be included in the dataset, and a value MUST be provided in that field for each record. OPTIONAL - The field MAY be omitted from the dataset. If an OPTIONAL column is included, some of the entries in that field MAY be empty strings. An omitted field is equivalent to a field that is empty. Conditionally REQUIRED - The field or file is REQUIRED under certain conditions, which are outlined in the field or file description. Outside of these conditions, this field or file is OPTIONAL. Files \u00b6 File Name REQUIRED Defines gbfs.json Yes (as of v2.0) Auto-discovery file that links to all of the other files published by the system. gbfs_versions.json (added in v1.1) OPTIONAL Lists all feed endpoints published according to versions of the GBFS documentation. system_information.json Yes Details including system operator, system location, year implemented, URL, contact info, time zone. vehicle_types.json (added in v2.1) Conditionally REQUIRED Describes the types of vehicles that System operator has available for rent. REQUIRED of systems that include information about vehicle types in the free_bike_status file. If this file is not included, then all vehicles in the feed are assumed to be non-motorized bicycles. station_information.json Conditionally REQUIRED List of all stations, their capacities and locations. REQUIRED of systems utilizing docks. station_status.json Conditionally REQUIRED Number of available vehicles and docks at each station and station availability. REQUIRED of systems utilizing docks. free_bike_status.json Conditionally REQUIRED (as of v2.1) Describes all vehicles that are not currently in active rental. REQUIRED for free floating (dockless) vehicles. OPTIONAL for station based (docked) vehicles. Vehicles that are part of an active rental MUST NOT appear in this feed. system_hours.json OPTIONAL Hours of operation for the system. system_calendar.json OPTIONAL Dates of operation for the system. system_regions.json OPTIONAL Regions the system is broken up into. system_pricing_plans.json OPTIONAL System pricing scheme. system_alerts.json OPTIONAL Current system alerts. geofencing_zones.json (added in v2.1) OPTIONAL Geofencing zones and their associated rules and attributes. Accessibility \u00b6 Datasets SHOULD be published at an easily accessible, public, permanent URL. (e.g., www.agency.org/gbfs/v2-2/gbfs.json). The URL SHOULD be directly available without requiring login to access the file to facilitate download by consuming software applications. To be compliant with GBFS, all systems MUST have an entry in the systems.csv file. Feed Availability \u00b6 Automated tools for application performance monitoring SHOULD be used to ensure feed availability. Producers SHOULD provide a technical contact who can respond to feed outages in the feed_contact_email field in the system_information.json file. Seasonal Shutdowns, Disruptions of Service \u00b6 Feeds SHOULD continue to be published during seasonal or temporary shutdowns. Feed URLs SHOULD NOT return a 404. An empty bikes array SHOULD be returned by free_bike_status.json . Stations in station_status.json SHOULD be set to is_renting:false , is_returning:false and is_installed:false where applicable. Seasonal shutdown dates SHOULD be reflected in system_calendar.json . Announcements for disruptions of service, including disabled stations or temporary closures of stations or systems SHOULD be made in system_alerts.json . File Requirements \u00b6 All files SHOULD be valid JSON All files in the spec MAY be published at a URL path or with an alternate name (e.g., station_info instead of station_information.json ) (as of v2.0) . All data SHOULD be UTF-8 encoded Line breaks SHOULD be represented by unix newline characters only (\\n) Pagination is not supported. File Distribution \u00b6 Files are distributed as individual HTTP endpoints. REQUIRED files MUST NOT 404. They MUST return a properly formatted JSON file as defined in Output Format . OPTIONAL files MAY 404. A 404 of an OPTIONAL file SHOULD NOT be considered an error. Auto-Discovery \u00b6 Publishers SHOULD implement auto-discovery of GBFS feeds by linking to the location of the gbfs.json auto-discovery endpoint. * The location of the auto-discovery file SHOULD be provided in the HTML area of the shared mobility landing page hosted at the URL specified in the URL field of the system_infomation.json file. This is referenced via a link tag with the following format: <link rel=\"gbfs\" type=\"application/json\" href=\"https://www.example.com/data/gbfs.json\" /> References: http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-faq#How_is_rel_used A shared mobility landing page MAY contain links to auto-discovery files for multiple systems. Localization \u00b6 Each set of data files SHOULD be distributed in a single language as defined in system_information.json. A system that wants to publish feeds in multiple languages SHOULD do so by publishing multiple distributions, such as: https://www.example.com/data/en/system_information.json https://www.example.com/data/fr/system_information.json Text Fields and Naming \u00b6 Rich text SHOULD NOT be stored in free form text fields. Fields SHOULD NOT contain HTML. All customer-facing text strings (including station names) SHOULD use Mixed Case (not ALL CAPS), following local conventions for capitalization of place names on displays capable of displaying lower case characters. Examples: Central Park South Villiers-sur-Marne Market Street Abbreviations SHOULD NOT be used for names and other text (e.g. St. for Street) unless a location is called by its abbreviated name (e.g. \u201cJFK Airport\u201d). Abbreviations may be problematic for accessibility by screen reader software and voice user interfaces. Consuming software can be engineered to reliably convert full words to abbreviations for display, but converting from abbreviations to full words is prone to more risk of error. Names used for stations, virtual stations and geofenced areas SHOULD be human readable. Naming conventions used for locations SHOULD consider a variety of use cases including both text and maps. Descriptions SHOULD NOT include information so specific that it could be used in tracking of vehicles or trips. Coordinate Precision \u00b6 Feeds SHOULD provide 6 digits (0.000001) of precision for decimal degrees lat/lon coordinates. Decimal places Degrees Distance at the Equator 0 1.0 111 km 1 0.1 11.1 km 2 0.01 1.11 km 3 0.001 111 m 4 0.0001 11.1 m 5 0.00001 1.11 m 6 0.000001 0.11 m 7 0.0000001 1.11 cm Data Latency \u00b6 The data returned by the near-realtime endpoints station_status.json and free_bike_status.json SHOULD be as close to realtime as possible, but in no case should it be more than 5 minutes out-of-date. Appropriate values SHOULD be set using the ttl property for each endpoint based on how often the data in feeds are refreshed or updated. For near-realtime endpoints where the data should always be refreshed the ttl value SHOULD be 0 . The last_updated timestamp represents the publisher's knowledge of the current state of the system at this point in time. The last_reported timestamp represents the last time a station or vehicle reported its status to the operator's backend. Licensing \u00b6 It is RECOMMENDED that all GBFS data sets be offered under an open data license. Open data licenses allow consumers to freely use, modify and share GBFS data for any purpose in perpetuity. Licensing of GBFS data provides certainty to GBFS consumers, allowing them to integrate GBFS data into their work. All GBFS data sets SHOULD specify a license using the license_id field with an SPDX identifier or by using the license_url field with a URL pointing to a custom license in system_information.json . See the GBFS repo for a comparison of a subset of standard licenses . Field Types \u00b6 Array - A JSON element consisting of an ordered sequence of zero or more values. Boolean - One of two possible values, true or false . Boolean values MUST be JSON booleans, not strings (i.e. true or false , not \"true\" or \"false\" ). (as of v2.0) Date - Service day in the YYYY-MM-DD format. Example: 2019-09-13 for September 13th, 2019. Email - An email address. Example: example@example.com Enum (Enumerable values) - An option from a set of predefined constants in the \"Defines\" column. Enum values SHOULD be lowercase. Example: The rental_methods field contains values creditcard , paypass , etc... Float (added in v2.1) - A 32-bit floating point number. GeoJSON FeatureCollection - A FeatureCollection as described by the IETF RFC 7946 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3. GeoJSON Multipolygon - A Geometry Object as described by the IETF RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.7. ID - Should be represented as a string that identifies that particular entity. An ID: MUST be unique within like fields (e.g. station_id MUST be unique among stations) does not have to be globally unique, unless otherwise specified MUST NOT contain spaces MUST be persistent for a given entity (station, plan, etc). An exception is floating bike bike_id , which MUST NOT be persistent for privacy reasons (see free_bike_status.json ). (as of v2.0) Language - An IETF BCP 47 language code. For an introduction to IETF BCP 47, refer to http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt and http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/. Examples: en for English, en-US for American English, or de for German. Latitude - WGS84 latitude in decimal degrees. The value MUST be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to 90.0. Example: 41.890169 for the Colosseum in Rome. Longitude - WGS84 longitude in decimal degrees. The value MUST be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to 180.0. Example: 12.492269 for the Colosseum in Rome. Non-negative Float - A 32-bit floating point number greater than or equal to 0. Non-negative Integer - An integer greater than or equal to 0. Object - A JSON element consisting of key-value pairs (fields). String - Can only contain text. Strings MUST NOT contain any formatting codes (including HTML) other than newlines. Time - Service time in the HH:MM:SS format for the time zone indicated in system_information.json (00:00:00 - 47:59:59). Time can stretch up to one additional day in the future to accommodate situations where, for example, a system was open from 11:30pm - 11pm the next day (i.e. 23:30:00-47:00:00). Timestamp - Timestamp fields MUST be represented as integers in POSIX time. (e.g., the number of seconds since January 1st 1970 00:00:00 UTC) Timezone - TZ timezone from the https://www.iana.org/time-zones. Timezone names never contain the space character but MAY contain an underscore. Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones for a list of valid values. Example: Asia/Tokyo , America/Los_Angeles or Africa/Cairo . URI (added in v1.1) - A fully qualified URI that includes the scheme (e.g., com.abcrental.android:// ), and any special characters in the URI MUST be correctly escaped. See the following http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description of how to create fully qualified URI values. Note that URIs MAY be URLs. URL - A fully qualified URL that includes http:// or https:// , and any special characters in the URL MUST be correctly escaped. See the following http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description of how to create fully qualified URL values. Extensions Outside of the Specification \u00b6 To accommodate the needs of feed producers and consumers prior to the adoption of a change, additional fields can be added to feeds even if these fields are not part of the official specification. Custom extensions that may provide value to the GBFS community and align with the GBFS Guiding Principles SHOULD be proposed for inclusion in the specification through the change process. Field names of extensions SHOULD be prefixed with an underscore ( _) character. It is strongly RECOMMENDED that these additional fields be documented on the wiki page of the GBFS repository in this format: Submitted by Field Name File Name Defines Publisher's name _field_name Name of GBFS endpoint where field is used Description of purpose of use JSON Files \u00b6 Output Format \u00b6 Every JSON file presented in this specification contains the same common header information at the top level of the JSON response object: Field Name REQUIRED Type Defines last_updated Yes Timestamp Indicates the last time data in the feed was updated. This timestamp represents the publisher's knowledge of the current state of the system at this point in time. ttl Yes Non-negative integer Number of seconds before the data in the feed will be updated again (0 if the data should always be refreshed). version (added in v1.1) Yes String GBFS version number to which the feed confirms, according to the versioning framework. data Yes Object Response data in the form of name:value pairs. Example: { \"last_updated\" : 1609866247 , \"ttl\" : 3600 , \"version\" : \"2.2\" , \"data\" : { \"name\" : \"Citi Bike\" , \"system_id\" : \"citibike_com\" } } gbfs.json \u00b6 The gbfs.json discovery file SHOULD represent a single system or geographic area in which vehicles are operated.

If string, MUST be in decimal monetary value. (added in v2.2) Note: v3.0 may only allow non-negative float, therefore future implementations SHOULD be non-negative float. In case of non-rate price, this field is the total price. In case of rate price, this field is the base price that is charged only once per trip (e.g., price for unlocking) in addition to per_km_pricing and/or per_min_pricing . - is_taxable Yes Boolean Will additional tax be added to the base price? true - Yes. false - No. false MAY be used to indicate that tax is not charged or that tax is included in the base price. - description Yes String Customer-readable description of the pricing plan. This SHOULD include the duration, price, conditions, etc. that the publisher would like users to see. - per_km_pricing (added in v2.2) OPTIONAL Array Array of segments when the price is a function of distance travelled, displayed in kilometers. Total price is the addition of price and all segments in per_km_pricing and per_min_pricing . If this array is not provided, there are no variable prices based on distance. \u2003\u2003- start (added in v2.2) Yes Non-Negative Integer The kilometer at which this segment rate starts being charged (inclusive) . \u2003\u2003- rate (added in v2.2) Yes Float Rate that is charged for each kilometer interval after the start .

Examples (added in v2.2) \u00b6 Example 1: The user does not pay more than the base price for the first 10 km. After 10 km the user pays $1 per km. After 25 km the user pays $0.50 per km and an additional $3 every 5 km, the extension price, in addition to $0.50 per km. { \"last_updated\" : 1609866247 , \"ttl\" : 0 , \"version\" : \"2.2\" , \"data\" : { \"plans\" : [ { \"plan_id\" : \"plan2\" , \"name\" : \"One-Way\" , \"currency\" : \"USD\" , \"price\" : 2 , \"is_taxable\" : false , \"description\" : \"Includes 10km, overage fees apply after 10km.\" , \"per_km_pricing\" : [ { \"start\" : 10 , \"rate\" : 1 , \"interval\" : 1 , \"end\" : 25 }, { \"start\" : 25 , \"rate\" : 0.5 , \"interval\" : 1 }, { \"start\" : 25 , \"rate\" : 3 , \"interval\" : 5 } ] } ] } } Example 2: This example demonstrates a pricing scheme that has a rate both by minute and by km. The user is charged $0.25 per km as well as $0.50 per minute. Both of these rates happen concurrently and are not dependent on one another. { \"last_updated\" : 1609866247 , \"ttl\" : 0 , \"version\" : \"2.2\" , \"data\" : { \"plans\" : [ { \"plan_id\" : \"plan3\" , \"name\" : \"Simple Rate\" , \"currency\" : \"CAD\" , \"price\" : 3 , \"is_taxable\" : true , \"description\" : \"$3 unlock fee, $0.25 per kilometer and 0.50 per minute.\" , \"per_km_pricing\" : [ { \"start\" : 0 , \"rate\" : 0.25 , \"interval\" : 1 } ], \"per_min_pricing\" : [ { \"start\" : 0 , \"rate\" : 0.50 , \"interval\" : 1 } ] } ] } } system_alerts.json \u00b6 This feed is intended to inform customers about changes to the system that do not fall within the normal system operations. For example, system closures due to weather would be listed here, but a system that only operated for part of the year would have that schedule listed in the system_calendar.json feed. Obsolete alerts SHOULD be removed so the client application can safely present to the end user everything present in the feed. Field Name REQUIRED Type Defines alerts Yes Array Array of objects each indicating a system alert as defined below. - alert_id Yes ID Identifier for this alert. - type Yes Enum Valid values are: system_closure station_closure station_move other - times OPTIONAL Array Array of objects with the fields start and end indicating when the alert is in effect (e.g. when the system or station is actually closed, or when it is scheduled to be moved). \u2003- start Yes Timestamp Start time of the alert. \u2003- end OPTIONAL Timestamp End time of the alert. If there is currently no end time planned for the alert, this can be omitted. - station_ids OPTIONAL Array If this is an alert that affects one or more stations, include their ID(s). Otherwise omit this field. If both station_id and region_id are omitted, this alert affects the entire system. - region_ids OPTIONAL Array If this system has regions, and if this alert only affects certain regions, include their ID(s). Otherwise, omit this field. If both station_id s and region_id s are omitted, this alert affects the entire system. - url OPTIONAL URL URL where the customer can learn more information about this alert. - summary Yes String A short summary of this alert to be displayed to the customer. - description OPTIONAL String Detailed description of the alert. - last_updated OPTIONAL Timestamp Indicates the last time the info for the alert was updated. Example: { \"last_updated\" : 1604198100 , \"ttl\" : 60 , \"version\" : \"2.2\" , \"data\" :{ \"alerts\" :[ { \"alert_id\" : \"21\" , \"type\" : \"station_closure\" , \"station_ids\" :[ \"123\" , \"456\" , \"789\" ], \"times\" :[ { \"start\" : \"1604448000\" , \"end\" : \"1604674800\" } ], \"url\" : \"https://example.com/more-info\" , \"summary\" : \"Disruption of Service\" , \"description\" : \"The three stations on Broadway will be out of service from 12:00am Nov 3 to 3:00pm Nov 6th to accommodate road work\" , \"last_updated\" : 1604519393 } ] } } geofencing_zones.json (added in v2.1) \u00b6 Describes geofencing zones and their associated rules and attributes. Geofenced areas are delineated using GeoJSON in accordance with RFC 7946 . By default, no restrictions apply everywhere. Geofencing zones SHOULD be modeled according to restrictions rather than allowance. An operational area (outside of which vehicles cannot be used) SHOULD be defined with a counterclockwise polygon, and a limitation area (in which vehicles can be used under certain restrictions) SHOULD be defined with a clockwise polygon. Geofences and GPS operate in two dimensions. Restrictions placed on an overpass or bridge will also be applied to the roadway or path beneath. Care SHOULD be taken when developing geofence based policies that rely on location data. Location data from GPS, cellular and Wi-Fi signals are subject to interference resulting in accuracy levels in the tens of meters or greater. This may result in vehicles being placed within a geofenced zone when they are actually outside or adjacent to the zone. Transit time between server and client can also impact when a user is notified of a geofence based policy. A vehicle traveling at 15kph can be well inside of a restricted zone before a notification is received. Field Name REQUIRED Type Defines geofencing_zones Yes GeoJSON FeatureCollection Each geofenced zone and its associated rules and attributes is described as an object within the array of features, as follows. - type Yes String \u201cFeatureCollection\u201d (as per IETF RFC 7946 ). - features Yes Array Array of objects as defined below. \u2003- type Yes String \u201cFeature\u201d (as per IETF RFC 7946 ). \u2003- geometry Yes GeoJSON Multipolygon A polygon that describes where rides might not be able to start, end, go through, or have other limitations. A clockwise arrangement of points defines the area enclosed by the polygon, while a counterclockwise order defines the area outside the polygon ( right-hand rule ). All geofencing zones contained in this list are public (i.e., can be shown on a map for public use). \u2003- properties Yes Object Properties: As defined below, describing travel allowances and limitations. \u2003\u2003- name OPTIONAL String Public name of the geofencing zone. \u2003\u2003- start OPTIONAL Timestamp Start time of the geofencing zone. If the geofencing zone is always active, this can be omitted. \u2003\u2003- end OPTIONAL Timestamp End time of the geofencing zone. If the geofencing zone is always active, this can be omitted. \u2003\u2003- rules OPTIONAL Array Array that contains one object per rule as defined below. In the event of colliding rules within the same polygon, the earlier rule (in order of the JSON file) takes precedence. In the case of overlapping polygons, the combined set of rules associated with the overlapping polygons applies to the union of the polygons. In the event of colliding rules in this set, the earlier rule (in order of the JSON file) also takes precedence. \u2003\u2003\u2003- vehicle_type_id OPTIONAL Array Array of IDs of vehicle types for which any restrictions SHOULD be applied (see vehicle type definitions in PR #136 ). If vehicle_type_ids are not specified, then restrictions apply to all vehicle types. \u2003\u2003\u2003- ride_allowed Conditionally REQUIRED Boolean REQUIRED if rules array is defined. Is the undocked (\u201cfree bike\u201d) ride allowed to start and end in this zone? true - Undocked (\u201cfree bike\u201d) ride can start and end in this zone. false - Undocked (\u201cfree bike\u201d) ride cannot start and end in this zone. \u2003\u2003\u2003- ride_through_allowed Conditionally REQUIRED Boolean REQUIRED if rules array is defined. Is the ride allowed to travel through this zone? true - Ride can travel through this zone. false - Ride cannot travel through this zone. \u2003\u2003\u2003- maximum_speed_kph OPTIONAL Non-negative Integer What is the maximum speed allowed, in kilometers per hour? If there is no maximum speed to observe, this can be omitted.

The following sections describe how analytics can be added to these URIs, as well as some examples. For further examples, see \"What's New in GBFS\" . Analytics (added in v1.1) \u00b6 In all of the rental URI fields, a viewing app can report the origin of a deep link to request to a rental app by appending the client_id (added in v1.1) parameter to the URI along with the domain name for the viewing app. For example, if Google is the viewing app, it can append: client_id=google.com ...to the URI field to report that Google is the originator of the deep link request. If the Android URI is: com.abcrental.android://open.abc.app/stations?id=1234567890 ...then the URI used by Google would be: com.abcrental.android://open.abc.app/stations?id=1234567890&client_id=google.com Other supported parameters include: ad_id (added in v1.1) - Advertising ID issued to the viewing app (e.g., IFDA on iOS) token (added in v1.1) - A token identifier that was issued by the rental app to the viewing app. Examples (added in v1.1) \u00b6 Example 1 - App Links on Android and Universal Links on iOS are supported: system_information.json { \"last_updated\" : 1572447999 , \"ttl\" : 60 , \"version\" : \"2.2\" , \"data\" :{ \"system_id\" : \"abc_cityname\" , \"short_name\" : \"ABC Bike Rental\" , \"rental_apps\" :{ \"android\" :{ \"discovery_uri\" : \"com.abcrental.android://\" }, \"ios\" :{ \"discovery_uri\" : \"com.abcrental.ios://\" } } ... station_information.json { \"last_updated\" : 1609866247 , \"ttl\" : 60 , \"version\" : \"2.2\" , \"data\" :{ \"stations\" :[ { \"station_id\" : \"425\" , \"name\" : \"Coppertail\" , \"lat\" : 27.9563335328521 , \"lon\" : -82.430436084371 , \"rental_uris\" :{ \"android\" : \"https://www.abc.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=android\" , \"ios\" : \"https://www.abc.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=ios\" } }, ...

Geofencing zones SHOULD be modeled according to restrictions rather than allowance. An operational area (outside of which vehicles cannot be used) SHOULD be defined with a counterclockwise polygon, and a limitation area (in which vehicles can be used under certain restrictions) SHOULD be defined with a clockwise polygon. Geofences and GPS operate in two dimensions. Restrictions placed on an overpass or bridge will also be applied to the roadway or path beneath.

Field Name REQUIRED Type Defines geofencing_zones Yes GeoJSON FeatureCollection Each geofenced zone and its associated rules and attributes is described as an object within the array of features, as follows. - type Yes String \u201cFeatureCollection\u201d (as per IETF RFC 7946 ). - features Yes Array Array of objects as defined below. \u2003- type Yes String \u201cFeature\u201d (as per IETF RFC 7946 ). \u2003- geometry Yes GeoJSON Multipolygon A polygon that describes where rides might not be able to start, end, go through, or have other limitations. A clockwise arrangement of points defines the area enclosed by the polygon, while a counterclockwise order defines the area outside the polygon ( right-hand rule ). All geofencing zones contained in this list are public (i.e., can be shown on a map for public use). \u2003- properties Yes Object Properties: As defined below, describing travel allowances and limitations. \u2003\u2003- name OPTIONAL String Public name of the geofencing zone. \u2003\u2003- start OPTIONAL Timestamp Start time of the geofencing zone. If the geofencing zone is always active, this can be omitted. \u2003\u2003- end OPTIONAL Timestamp End time of the geofencing zone. If the geofencing zone is always active, this can be omitted. \u2003\u2003- rules OPTIONAL Array Array that contains one object per rule as defined below. In the event of colliding rules within the same polygon, the earlier rule (in order of the JSON file) takes precedence. In the case of overlapping polygons, the combined set of rules associated with the overlapping polygons applies to the union of the polygons. In the event of colliding rules in this set, the earlier rule (in order of the JSON file) also takes precedence. \u2003\u2003\u2003- vehicle_type_id OPTIONAL Array Array of IDs of vehicle types for which any restrictions SHOULD be applied (see vehicle type definitions in PR #136 ). If vehicle_type_ids are not specified, then restrictions apply to all vehicle types. \u2003\u2003\u2003- ride_allowed Conditionally REQUIRED Boolean REQUIRED if rules array is defined. Is the undocked (\u201cfree bike\u201d) ride allowed to start and end in this zone? true - Undocked (\u201cfree bike\u201d) ride can start and end in this zone. false - Undocked (\u201cfree bike\u201d) ride cannot start and end in this zone. \u2003\u2003\u2003- ride_through_allowed Conditionally REQUIRED Boolean REQUIRED if rules array is defined. Is the ride allowed to travel through this zone? true - Ride can travel through this zone. false - Ride cannot travel through this zone. \u2003\u2003\u2003- maximum_speed_kph OPTIONAL Non-negative Integer What is the maximum speed allowed, in kilometers per hour? If there is no maximum speed to observe, this can be omitted.

GBFS is an API specification. Consumer - A consumer is someone who is consuming and using GBFS data. Examples of GBFS consumers are trip planning or MaaS applications, researchers and regulators. Deep link - In the context of mobile apps, deep links enable linking to specific locations within an app rather than simply launching the app. GBFS deep links can be used to check if the user has a mobility service provider\u2019s app installed on their phone. If the app is installed, the user can be sent directly to the point of purchase for the vehicle they wish to rent within the app - significantly improving the user experience. If the app is not installed , they can be directed to the appropriate app store for download before continuing with the rental process. Endpoint - An endpoint is the specific digital location where a resource lives. GBFS endpoints are URLs that point to each of the files in a GBFS data set. The gbfs.json file contains a list of all the available endpoints in a gbfs data set. Feed - A feed, in the context of GBFS, is another name for an API endpoint or collection of endpoints. The term feed may be used in reference to a single file or the collection of files that make up a GBFS implementation. Geofencing - A geofence is a virtual boundary that defines a geographic area. When a shared mobility vehicle enters or exits a geofenced area, events can be triggered, for example a push notification can be sent to a user\u2019s phone. Geofencing may be used to delineate pick up and drop off zones, no-ride zones, speed limit zones, equity zones, etc. Producer - A producer is any entity that is publishing GBFS, most often producers are shared mobility system operators. Producer is sometimes used interchangeably with provider. Station - A station is a location where shared mobility vehicles are made available for rent. Stations may include physical infrastructure like rental kiosks, docks or racks, or they may be virtual, delineated by pavement markings, geofencing or other means. System - A system in the context of GBFS is a shared mobility service from a single provider represented by e GBFS data set. Systems are typically limited to the local geography in which they operate. A single mobility service provider may operate in many geographic locations, each of which would be considered a separate system. Systems may span municipal or political boundaries in cases where vehicles are permitted to operate across multiple jurisdictions. If a user could reasonably expect to be able to rent a vehicle in one jurisdiction and return it in another, those jurisdictions would be considered a single system.
